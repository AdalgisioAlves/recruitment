# Reversing a Queue

Give an algorithm for reversing a queue Q. Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue.
dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue.
empty() : Checks if a queue is empty or not.

## Examples:

```
Input : Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
Output :Q = [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

Input :[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output :[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
