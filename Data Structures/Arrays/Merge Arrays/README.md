# Merge an array of size n into another array of size m+n

There are two sorted arrays. First one is of size m+n containing only m elements. Another one is of size n and contains n elements. Merge these two arrays into the first array of size m+n such that the output is sorted.

`Input:` Array with m+n elements (mPlusN[]).
Merge mPlusN
NA => Value is not filled/available in array mPlusN[]. There should be n such array blocks.

`Input:` Array with n elements (N[]).
Merge N

`Output:` N[] merged into mPlusN[] (Modified mPlusN[])
