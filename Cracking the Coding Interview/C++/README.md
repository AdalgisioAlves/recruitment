## Chapter 13: C++

1. Write a method to print the last K lines of an input file using C++.

2. Compare and contrast a hash table vs. an STL map. How is a hash table implemented? If the number of inputs is small, what data structure options can be used instead of a hash table?

3. How do virtual functions work in C++?

4. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would use each.

5. What is the significance of the keyword “volatile” in C?

6. What is name hiding in C++?

7. Why does a destructor in base class need to be declared virtual?

8. Write a method that takes a pointer to a Node structure as a parameter and returns a complete copy of the passed-in data structure. The Node structure contains two pointers to other Node structures.

9. Write a smart pointer (smart_ptr) class.
