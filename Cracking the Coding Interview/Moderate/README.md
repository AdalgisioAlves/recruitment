## Chapter 19: Moderate

1. Write a function to swap a number in place without temporary variables.

2. Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won in a game of tic-tac-toe.

3. Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeros in n factorial.

4. Write a method which finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator.

5. The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:  The computer has four slots containing balls that are red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have `RGGB` (e.g., Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue). You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess `YRGB`. When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a `“hit”`. If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a `“pseudo-hit”`. For example, the guess `YRGB` has 2 hits and one pseudo hit. For each guess, you are told the number of hits and pseudo-hits. Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo hits.

7. You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the continuous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.

8. Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book.

10. Write a method to generate a random number between 1 and 7, given a method that generates a random number between 1 and 5 (i.e., implement rand7() using rand5()).

11. Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.
