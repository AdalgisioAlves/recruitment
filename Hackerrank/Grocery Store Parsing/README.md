# Grocery Store

You work at a grocery store and you are asked to track customer's purchasing habits by scanning frequent shoppers cards. Your cash register logs all transactions to a pipe -delimited flat text file in the following format.
`customer_name|product_category|item_description|cost`
Write a script or program that parses the log file and generates the following output:
1. Total Revenue per Customer
2. Per Category Spending of each Customer
3. Sales Tax (per item sales tax is 9.25%)
