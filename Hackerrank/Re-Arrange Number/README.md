# Rearrange Number

You are given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`. You want to know whether it's possible to construct a new integer `num` using all the digits of these numbers. You can reorder the digits as you want. The resulting number can contain leading zeros.

## Example:

For example, consider the numbers `50, 40, 90`. We want to check if its possible to construct the number `5490` from this.
The answer should be `true`, since it's possible to construct `5490` by interchanging digits of `504090`.
